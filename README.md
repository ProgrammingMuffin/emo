### emo player

#### This is basically related to my mini project.

It is an emotion based music player that uses Haar-Cascade classifier to detect facial emotions and picks a song from the database and plays it.

whatever code I've written for the front-end and back-end for the web based stuff, is present here..

The python code will be posted somewhere else in another repository by my teammates.
