					Emo is a web based music player that focuses on the user's emotions. 
					Emo will select songs based on your emotion/mood at that time and tries to neutralize it. 
					Emo provides a small emotion gathering UI where the user can provide information which would be further 
					manipulated to serve the user from a repository of suitable counter-emotion songs.

			<div class="answer" >
				Okay, here comes the nerdy stuff. Firstly, we accept your user credentials, mostly this involves your emotions and music browsing habits.
				Then we process this received data and we select a counter-emotion song from a repository of high quality and authentic songs.
				Once that part is done, we play that music directly from a high persistence cloud server and Voila! we have successfully neutralized
				your emotions.
